# How to build an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline using AWS Glue, Amazon S3, Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Athena.

In this workshop, we will build an end-to-end pipeline to predict the accessibility of playgrounds in NYC based on borough, and tax income information. Our pipeline will combine several different data sources, use AWS Glue for serverless extract-transform-load (ETL) jobs, Amazon SageMaker for Machine learning, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for storage and staging the datasets, and Amazon Athena to make inferences from the trained machine learning model directly using SQL functions.

In addition to training ML models using existing SageMaker functionality, you will learn how to use SageMaker APIs to launch an AutoPilot job from a Jupyter environment, which allows you to automatically build, train and tune ML models. 

By the end of this lab, your data scientists and analysts will learn how to directly obtain predictions from ML models using just SQL queries. The inferences can directly then be ingested into a database for OLAP or business intelligence. 

## Preferred Region:
The Athena feature at the end of this lab is still in Preview (as of 05-01-2020) and available in "us-east-1". We caution however that APIs can often change between preview to when a feature becomes generally available, so we are including it in the lab for testing purposes only. 

The end-to-end architecture we will build in this lab is the following:

## Machine Learning

Next navigate to the s3 bucket where your parquet file is created (<<userid>>-processed bucket) and download the file locally on your computer.
    
**Note: For ML Immersion Labs, you don't need to complete the "Inferences using Amazon Athena" Sectoin. Simply upload the parquet file you downloaded to your SageMaker notebook environment and run through the rest of the lab from the notebook entitled "Predict_accessibility_using_ML.ipynb". To download the notebook, git clone this repo locally and upload the notebook from the local folder to your SageMaker Instance. See below  for the steps**
    
In the AWS console, search and find Amazon SageMaker, and click Create Notebook Instance. <br/>
Give the notebook instance a name such as sagemaker-<<userid>>-notebook or any name of your choice which matches the required naming convention. <br/>
Leave the defaults for instance type <br/>
In **Permissions and Encryption**, choose *Create a new role* and enter the name of your S3 bucket (<<userid>>-processed bucket). This ensures that SageMaker has access to this bucket for storing model artifacts and processed features. <br/>
Click Create Role and Create Notebook Instance.
    
Once the notebook instance is created, click on Open Jupyter. Download the "Predict_accessibility_using_ML.ipynb" notebook on your local computer. 
Click Upload in the Jupyter console and upload both the parquet file and the ipynb to Jupyter. 

Once uploaded, follow the steps in the Predict_accessibility_using_ML.ipynb Notebook to complete the rest of the lab.
**Remember**: replace the bucket name with your bucket <<userid>>-processed bucket, and filename with the name of your parquet file.  

**Remember**: Do not delete your SageMaker endpoints until you complete the Athena portion below. If you delete them by accident, simply recreate the SageMaker endpoint by re-running the code cell shown below

```python
xgb_predictor = xgb.deploy(initial_instance_count=1,
                                 instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge')
```
 
Once your endpoints are up and running, we will run some inferences using Amazon Athena. 

## Inferences using Amazon Athena (only in us-east-1)

As of 2019 Re:Invent, AWS introduced a new feature whereby analysts and data scientists can directly query their machine learning models using SQL without having to write any custom python code. This enables data scientists and analysts to directly ingest predictions from their ML models into a database of their choice, run SQL queries for further analytics and business intelligence.

Note: As of 05-01-2020, this feature is only available in **us-east-1**, so only complete the rest of this lab if you did the entire lab in us-east-1.

Here we will show how this works.

Since this is a new feature, as of this Github repo, the feature is still in **Preview**. This requires one additional stepsin order to get it to work.

Navigate to the Amazon Athena console. <br/>
Click Connect to Data Source and Choose S3 and AWS Glue for the Data Catalog. <br/>
Select Set up crawler in AWS Glue ... and click on **Connect to AWS Glue**. <br/>

This will open a separate page for AWS Glue. Enter a name for your crawler, choose data stores, keep the default to S3 and 
using the folder icon, navigate to the *folder* containing the train.csv file in your bucket. 

**Caution**: it is very important to not enter the full path ending in /train.csv, but rather only up to the folder containing the train.csv file. If you do the former, your Athena queries won't return any results. Make sure to put a "/" after the folder name containing the train.csv file.

Click Next, Next and Create an IAM role. Click Next <br/>
Set Frequency to run on demand <br/>
For database, choose the database name you chose above <<userid>>-raw, Click Next and Finish. 
    
Run the crawler. 

Once the crawler has successfully completed, navigate to the Athena Query Editor. You should find a "train" table created containing columns col0 ... col12.

**Important**
While the ML feature is still in preview, you need this additiona step:

Click on Workgroup <br/>
Create Workgroup <br/>
For workgroup name, Enter: AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality <br/>
For Query Result Location, use the folder icon to navigate to the <<user-id>>-processed bucket to store your query artifacts. <br/>
Click Create Workgroup <br/>

Once the Workgroup is created, ensure that this workgroup is selected, and click Switch Workgroup.

Remember that the XGBoost algorithm requires that all headers are removed before saving the train.csv file, so Glue assigns column names to the columms. Also notice that col0 is the actual labels.

We will now call our SageMaker endpoint and test our predictions on the training data. 

In the SageMaker console, navigate to Endpoints, and copy the name of the endpoint you just created for your standalone XGBoost model (not AutoPilot) to the clipboard. It should look something like this: **sagemaker-xgboost-####**

To do so, in the Query editor, write the following query, but replace where it says :
```sql
sagemaker_endpoint = 'your endpoint here': 
```
with your endpoint name and replace "sampledb" in below 

```sql
FROM sampledb.train
```

with the name of your database. 

```sql
USING FUNCTION predict(col1 double, col2 double, col3 double, col4 double, col5 double,
                       col6 double, col7 bigint, col8 bigint, col9 bigint, col10 bigint, col11 bigint, col12 bigint) 
                       returns double type SAGEMAKER_INVOKE_ENDPOINT
WITH (sagemaker_endpoint='sagemaker-xgboost-2019-12-23-19-06-32-813')

SELECT ROUND(predict(col1, col2, col3, col4, col5, col6, col7, col8, col9, col10, col11, col12)) AS PREDICTED, col0 AS ACTUAL
FROM 
    (SELECT *
FROM sampledb.train)
```

It should look like this:
![](media/image20.png)

Click Run.

Once the query is run, the final output should look something like this:

![](media/image21.png)

and that's it!

You now have produced inferences using your ML model using Amazon Athena using data in S3, without a single line of python code!


Conclusion
==========

In this lab you have learned how to leverage AWS glue to collect data
from different sources, store the raw data on S3 and process and save
the result on S3. You analyzed raw and processed data using Athena and
also automated the data processing pipeline using Glow workflow. 

Following this, you trained used Amazon SageMaker to ingest the parquet files from Glue,
perform some data exploration and feature engineering and stage the processed features into an S3 bucket. You then trained an ML model using Amazon SageMaker's built in algorithms as well as SageMaker AutoPilot which automates a lot of the feature engineering tasks common in a data science workflow. 

Finally once a trained model was generated, you deployed the model in Amazon SageMaker and performed inferences against that model using Amazon Athena with minimal code. This allows analysts to directly benefit from trained machine learning model using just SQL code.
