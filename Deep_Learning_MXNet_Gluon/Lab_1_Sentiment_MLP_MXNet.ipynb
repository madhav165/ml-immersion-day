    "# What is MLP\n",
    "\n",
    "A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network model that maps sets of input data onto a set of appropriate outputs. An MLP consists of multiple layers of nodes in a directed graph, with each layer fully connected to the next one. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron (or processing element) with a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training the network\n",

    "Apache MXnet is an open-source machine learning framework. It allows to build, train, and port deep learning models. MXNet is supported by AWS, Intel, Microsoft as well as educational instituions such as  MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and University of Washington. MXNet combines flexibility, high performance, and scalability which make it a great choice for many machine learning use cases. MXNet also have Gluon library which implements clear and intuitive API for deep learning models without sacrificing performance and scalability. \n",

    "Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing (NLP) to determine the attitude expressed by an author in a piece of written text towards a topic, e.g. movie review. The attitude can be positive, neutral, and negative.\n",
    "From a machine learning perspective, sentiment analysis can be treated as a classification problem. In the tutorial, we will train an MLP based model for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "While there are other algorithms, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that are better at capturing the syntactic structure of the sentence for sentiment analysis, MLP is a straight and simple network that is quick to train.\n"

    "- Blake Edwards' legendary fiasco, begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle Has Landed, Star!, Oh! What a Lovely War!, and Edwards' Pink Panther films, Darling Lili never engages the viewer; the aerial sequences, the musical numbers, the romance, the comedy, and the espionage are all ho hum. At what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn? This disaster wavers in tone, never decides what it wants to be, and apparently thinks it's a spoof, but it's pathetically and grindingly square. Old fashioned in the worst sense, audiences understandably stayed away in droves. It's awful. James Garner would have been a vast improvement over Hudson who is just cardboard, and he doesn't connect with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson don't seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness. Blake Edwards' SOB isn't much more than OK, but it's the only good that ever came out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional look of much of Darling Lili, only make what it's all lavished on even more difficult to bear. To quote Paramount chief Robert Evans, 24 million dollars worth of film and no picture.\n",

    "- A mean spirited, repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children. Susan Strasberg is totally wasted in a 5-minute cameo, even though she receives star billing. If you are a Julie Brown fan, you'll want to check it out, since she's naked in a couple of shots. All others,avoid.\n",

    "- I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine. I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.\n",

    "- This is one of my three all-time favorite movies. My only quibble is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene, but the performances were so great I forgive him. Albert Finney and Tom are absolutely marvelous; brilliant. The script is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and, therefore, what it was like in the 30s as well). Lots of great, subtle touches, lots of broad, overplayed strokes, all of it perfectly done. Scene after scene just blows me away, and then there's the heartbreaking climax.\n",
